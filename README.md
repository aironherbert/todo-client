# TODO LIST (Client)

This app is written with React, Typescript, Material UI, and Apollo Client. The users are created automatically, and if the user already exists it simply load all the todos saved for this user. There is no authentication, although you can choose a user name that only you know.

The production version of this app can be found at [Airon Todo Client](https://airon-todo-client.netlify.app/).

To run this app locally, you need the server to be also running on your machine. You can clone it at [Airon Todo Server](https://github.com/aironherbert/todo).

You can also change the uri from Apollo Client to [Production Server App](https://misty-voice-2266.fly.dev/api). In this way you can run the frontend of the app locally, but keeping the server side at production.

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
